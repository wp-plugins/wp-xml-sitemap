An easy way to add Xml sitemap in your website .It can be especially helpful if your content is not easily discoverable by our crawler (such as pages accessible only through a form).

== Description ==

 WPSitemap.Xml  is an XML file that lists the URLs for a site. It allows webmasters to include additional information about each URL: when it was last updated, how often it changes, and how important it is in relation to other URLs in the site. This allows search engines to crawl the site more intelligently.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: How do I represent URLs in the Sitemap? = 
As with all XML files, any data values (including URLs) must use entity escape codes for the following characters: ampersand (&), single quote ('), double quote ("), less than (<), and greater than (>). You should also make sure that all URLs follow the RFC-3986 standard for URIs, the RFC-3987 standard for IRIs, and the XML standard. If you are using a script to generate your URLs, you can generally URL escape them as part of that script. You will still need to entity escape them.

= Q: Does it matter which character encoding method I use to generate my Sitemap files? =
Yes. Your Sitemap files must use UTF-8 encoding.


= Q: I submitted a Sitemap, but my URLs haven't been [crawled/indexed] yet. Isn't that what a Sitemap is for? =
A: Submitting a Sitemap helps you make sure Google knows about the URLs on your site. It can be especially helpful if your content is not easily discoverable by our crawler (such as pages accessible only through a form). It is not, however, a guarantee that those URLs will be crawled or indexed. We use information from Sitemaps to augment our usual crawl and discovery processes.

= Q: Will a Sitemap help me rank better? =
A: A Sitemap does not affect the actual ranking of your pages. However, if it helps get more of your site crawled (by notifying us of URLs we didn't previously didn't know about, and/or by helping us prioritize the URLs on your site), that can lead to increased presence and visibility of your site in our index.

= Q: Where can I put my Sitemap? Does it have to be at the root of my site? =
A: We recently enabled Sitemap cross-submissions, which means that you can put your Sitemap just about plugin's folder or root as well.
